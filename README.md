# Solutions to CS231n Assigments

This repo contains some solutions and other experiments on the assigments and topics on
Standford CS231n course which I am taking on own (self-paced self-study).

The solutions might not be the best implementation-wise. I have re-formatted some python original files
to be more "pythonic" (e.g. indentation 4 spaces and so on), the original are found in with the ".bak" extension.
