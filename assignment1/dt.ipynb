    "I writing this post because I wanted to (re)learn about decision trees. I don't remember if I ever learned about the  or if I did it was a long time ago and many of the concepts are fuzzy. In any case I started looking at the online resources anbd I couldn't find a straight forward tutorial so I decided to write this as part of the #100DaysMLCode challenge. \n",

    "## What are Decision Trees\n",
    "Decision tree is a ML algorithm that tries to generate a set of rules to predict a value. The value can be a number (regression) or a category (binary or multilabel classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementations are found in popular ML packages such as scikit-learn where you can basically use them without knowing the internal but before going there I implement an example to understand the inner workings.\n",
